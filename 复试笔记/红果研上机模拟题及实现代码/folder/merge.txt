Parsing is an important problem in natural language
processing which has been studied extensively for
decades. Between the two basic paradigms of parsing, constituency parsing, the subject of this paper,
has in general proved to be the more difficult than
dependency parsing, both in terms of accuracy and
the run time of parsing algorithms.
To remedy this, we design a new parsing framework that is more suitable for constituency parsing,
and that can be accurately modeled by neural networks.
The parser alternates between two types of actions, structural and label, where the structural actions follow a path to make the stack spans correspond to sentence phrases in a bottom-up manner,
while the label actions optionally create tree brackets for the top span on the stack. There are only two
structural actions: shift is the same as other transition systems, while combine merges the top two sentence spans. The latter is analogous to a reduce action, but it does not immediately create a tree structure and is non-directional. Label actions do create
a partial tree on top of the stack by assigning one or
more non-terminals to the topmost span.
For the particular case of our transition constituency parser, we use only four span features to
determine a structural action, and three to determine
a label action, in each case partitioning the sentence
exactly. The reason for this is straightforward: when
considering a structural action, the top two spans on
the stack must be considered to determine whether
they should be combined, while for a label action,
only the top span on the stack is important, since that
is the candidate for labeling. In both cases the remaining sentence prefix and suffix are also included.
These features are shown in Table 1.
